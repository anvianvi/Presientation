				React its not a framework.

				React it's free and open-source JavaScript library.</section>
			<section>
				History<br><br>
				React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React
				called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on
				Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May
				2013.
				On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public. The release introduced React Hooks.

			</section>
			<section>Why i think that React is cool?<br><br>
				React use of a virtual Document Object Model. React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the
				resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently. This process is called
				reconciliation.
			</section>
			<section>
				Reconciliation in React<br><br>This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on
				each change, while
				the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change. This selective rendering provides a major
				performance boost. It saves the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the
				entire page.</section>
			<section>
				<ul>Notable features
					<li>Declarative</li>
					<li>Components</li>
					<li>Functional components</li>
					<li>JSX</li>
					<li>Architecture beyond HTML</li>
					<li>React hooks</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>Declarative<br><br>
				React adheres to the declarative programming paradigm. Developers design views for each state of an application,
				and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.
			</section>
			<section>Components<br><br>React code is made of entities called components. These components are reusable and
				must be
				formed in the
				SRC folder following the Pascal Case as its naming convention (capitalize camelCase). Components can be rendered
				to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library.

				The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class-based
				components.
			</section>
			<section>Functional components<br><br>
				Function components are declared with a function that then returns some JSX.
				<br><br>

				<pre><code> const Greeter = () => <div>Hello World</div> </code></pre>
			</section>
			<section>JSX<br><br>JSX, or JavaScript Syntax Extension, is an extension to the JavaScript language
				syntax. Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax
				familiar to many developers. React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be
				(components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by
				Facebook for PHP called XHP.</section>
			<section>Architecture beyond HTML<br><br>
				The basic architecture of React applies beyond rendering HTML in the browser. For example, Facebook has dynamic
				charts that render to <b>canvas</b> tags, and Netflix and PayPal use universal loading to render identical HTML
				on both the server and client.
			</section>
			<section>React hooks<br><br>
				Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function
				components. Hooks do not work inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes.

				React provides a few built-in hooks like useState, useContext, useReducer, useMemo and useEffect.
				Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference. useState and useEffect, which are the most commonly used,
				are for controlling state and side effects respectively.</section>
			<section>
				Rules of hooks<br><br>
				There are rules of hooks which describe the characteristic code pattern that hooks rely on. It is the modern
				way to handle state with React.
				<ul>
					<li>Hooks should only be called at the top level (not inside loops or if statements).</li>
					<li>Hooks should only be called from React function components and custom hooks, not normal functions or class
						components.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Facebook</li>
					<li>Instagram</li>
